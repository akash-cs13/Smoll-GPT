wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Sparkling Blend : Always one of Spain's best bubblies, this is precise and dry, with a dusty apple aroma and only a bit of yeast on the bouquet. It feels expansive and rich, with cutting acidity that's offset by yeasty cream, toast and butterscotch flavors. Juicy and generous at the same time.[EOD]wine review : US : Oregon : Chardonnay : This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove. The 20-year-old vines provide the complexity and detail that will reward another decade of aging. Drink now through 2025.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Kremstal : Riesling : This is a bone dry, while rich wine that is now mature. It has weight, secondary almond and spice flavors, as well as tight acidity and a very mineral character. It has crispness rather than freshness, bringing a taut structure into play along with the concentration. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Cabernet Sauvignon : Despite the fact that this smells green, it scores points in the mouth, where it's dense and chewy. This also tastes green and highly herbal, but it's full across the palate, with a sense of richness that helps offset the wine's bell-pepper character.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Red Blend : This blend of 53% Zinfandel, 26% Petite Sirah and 21% Syrah shows grape candy and roasted beef crust on the nose. The flavors are dark with creosote, licorice and dark chocolate, proving to be a heavy, thick wine that's balanced by plum-skin tannins.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Dark berry, pressed flower, iron, leather and spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, eucalyptus, anise and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's already almost approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Thermenregion : St. Laurent : Fresh, juicy and fruity with a light tannic structure, this is pure blackberry juice, with just some of that cranberry tannin and dryness, finished with licorice. Ready to drink.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Red Blend : This blend of 87% Syrah and 13% Merlot mixes plummy blackberry, blueberry and leather flavors. An earthiness marked by roses permeates the nose and palate, buoyed by bright acidity and a tangy lift of cranberry and white pepper.[EOD]wine review : Germany : Rheingau : Riesling : Hugely ripe, with 14.5% alcohol and a touch of residual sweetness, but also a richly textured mouthfeel and layers of honey, apricot preserves, slate-driven minerality and spice. It may be a bit precariously balanced, so opt for drinking it over the near term.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo : Dark, alluring aromas of licorice, blackberry and toast share space with earthy, mossy notes on the nose of this full-bodied winner that's showing wall-to-wall weight and tannins. Black plum, cassis and tobacco flavors are a common Rioja trifecta, as are dry, peppery, figgy flavors on the finish. Drink from 2018–2028.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style White Blend : Tight and crisply fruity, this wine comes from a property in the Vignobles Signé family since 1649. With a strong herbal character, it is refreshing and already delicious, bright and lively. Plenty of acidity keeps this wine packed with forward fruit. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : France : Burgundy : Pinot Noir : While this wine is firm, with some fine tannins, it also has a pure line in fresh strawberry fruits that will develop as the tannins soften. This perfumed wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2020.[EOD]wine review : France : Languedoc-Roussillon : Cinsault : Fresh and lively with flavors of strawberry, cherry, raspberry and red plum pulp. The acidity subdues the stronger fruit flavors on the palate, balancing everything out nicely. Moderate weight with a full texture and a zingy, lingering finish.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Right out of the bottle, this wine smells and tastes tight and unappealing. It's marked by drying tannins and earthiness, giving it a rustic quality. Still, there's a good core of cherry fruit.[EOD]wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Sauvignon Blanc : This wine shows the tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc with pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity is there, floral and ripe. The wine is ready to drink now.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Maturing well, yet with plenty of aging ahead, this is a firm and fragrant selection. It has a ripe berry flavor and a hint of truffle, with sweet acidity and a dense, rich structure.[EOD]wine review : US : Washington : Syrah : Fermented with 100% stems and aged in neutral French oak, this textbook example of this top Syrah site brings aromas of smoked meat, purple fruit, crushed violets and fresh parsley along with other green herbs. The palate's über-fresh fruit and savory flavors are supported by tart bright acids. This one will only get better with some bottle age and will truly shine at the dinner table. Best from 2022 through 2030.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Rapel Valley : Cabernet Blend : All this Cab blend needs is time in the glass and it'll show floral, alluring aromas and then big raspberry and plum flavors. It starts quietly and then pounds through with saturated fruit, chocolate and firm tannins.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : There's enough unripe fruity flavor in this wine to detract from its pleasure. As dry, crisp and silky as it is, its cherry and cola flavors are marred by a sharp, green taste of menthol.[EOD]wine review : France : France Other : Vermentino : This delicious, refreshing wine has crisp acidity and bright red apple fruit. Shot through with with zesty lemon character, it finishes with a waft of white floral perfume. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : Pinot Grigio : Elegant and sophisticated, this has soft aromas of apricot, honey, citrus and pear. Fresh acidity is followed by a touch of savory spice.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Levante : Red Blend : An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit. The palate has punch and size but also saucy, herbal flavors and a leathery, salinic finish. Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Verdejo : Aromas of chewing gum and sulfuric grit lack fruit. This feels wiry and narrow, with hardly any body. Salty, briny apple and orange flavors finish hollow. Overall, this is just a light, quaffable, generic white wine.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : There's something delicious about this wine, but it's not very Pinot Noir-like. Aromas of barbecue, bacon fat, smoked meats and strawberry carry through to the flavor profile, making it a perfect pairing for grilled ribs.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Veneto : Corvina : Opulent as well as elegant, this structured red boasts aromas of black currant, exotic spice, new oak and fragrant blue flower. Made entirely with native grape Corvina, the velvety palate doles out spiced blackberry, juicy cherry, licorice and black pepper. Firm, polished tannins provide the smooth framework.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Rosé : Briny citrus aromas are pungent, and in general this runs strong on pyrazines and bell pepper scents. A tight, juicy, firm palate is home to citric flavors of pink grapefruit and orange.[EOD]wine review : US : Oregon : Red Blend : This is not labeled as such, but it's Petite Sirah. The fruit is young, plummy, with purple-berry flavors in abundance. It drops off in the midpalate, but returns in a ripe but not too potent finish. Tannins are proportionate. All in all, this is your optimal pizza wine.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Verdejo : Subtle and sweet on the nose, it has aromas of honey, peach and melon. Standard nettle, gooseberry and slightly-mealy citrus flavors mark the palate. This finishes chunky yet easygoing. Drink immediately.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Burgenland : Blaufränkisch : Properly rustic, this has firm and dry tannins, a powerful structure to go with the wood aging and black plum flavor. It has pepper, spice and toast notes, with layers of acidity. The finish is very dry and firm. Screwcap.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : This wine combines smoky, baked blackberry fruit with sweet vanilla accents. It's full bodied, soft and smooth on the palate, proving likably approachable.[EOD]wine review : US : Virginia : Seyval Blanc : Lime and orange peel remain in front of dried apricot and nuts on the nose. The palate shows soft grassiness and lifted acidity, which keeps the feel lean and short.[EOD]wine review : France : Southwest France : Malbec : This is the young fruity wine from the Cèdre estate that also produces some of the most serious wines in Cahors. It is soft, packed with black fruits and with layers of spicy acidity. There is just a touch of tannin, which will make the wine a great barbecue accompaniment this summer.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Sagrantino : Aromas of underbrush, leather, truffle and a balsamic note lead the nose on this lush wine. On the concentrated palate, ripe plum and blackberry take center stage while notes of vanilla, mocha, licorice and clove play supporting roles. Velvety tannins generate a smooth texture and make it extremely approachable. Drink through 2019.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : A very savory nose calls to mind mushrooms sautéed in Italian herbs, with touches of eucalyptus and licorice on the fringes. The mouthfeel is light in density, alive with acidity and tannins, tending more towards marinated black olives and charcuterie than ripe red fruits.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Rhône-style White Blend : Easy, appealing and frankly sweet, this is very rich in citrus, tropical fruit and honey flavors. A blend of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.[EOD]wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Rosé : This blend of Touriga Nacional with Merlot is perfumed and light. It has a salmon pink color, layers of citrus as well as red-currant fruit and a soft texture. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : The big question about this wine is will it age. It certainly appeals to the palate for its flashy sweetness, ripe in blackberries, raspberries, cherries and cocoa. And there's a generous overlay of oak. Still, it's hard to get past a certain directness. Your best bet is to stash it away and keep your fingers crossed over the next six years.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Lots of toasty, caramelized oak tones combine with ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. It seems a little sweet on the finish, but that's balanced by a swirl of acidity. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Sparkling Blend : Straightforward apple and spice aromas draw you in. The palate on this value-priced brut Cava is fresh and focused, with mango, citrus, spice and dried herb flavors. It finishes fresh, with a touch of quince and apple flavor. Good for the price.[EOD]wine review : Canada : British Columbia : Meritage : An artful blend of 43% Cab Franc, 28% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Petit Verdot, this captures the seductive sensuality of the winery's excellent lineup of red varietals. Ripe berry, plum and cherry fruit is swathed in dense highlights of herbs and spices. It's complex and captivating, while remaining refined, even elegant.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : A full array of chaparral aromas arise prominently on this bottling, with thyme and sagebrush spicing up the smoke, earth, crushed slate and dark-cherry scents. The palate zings with snappy black-raspberry fruit, a great counterpoint to the savory shrubbiness that reflects the nose, with more wild herbs and eucalyptus notes. Quite a full experience.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Burgenland : Rosé : Shimmering with the palest salmon pink, this is a softly scented, restrained but very refreshing rosé. Absolutely dry, it majors on fresh lemon notes with tart inflections of red currant. The slightest fizz helps the freshness even more. Lovely.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Maipo Valley : Cabernet Sauvignon : Abrasive cherry and plum aromas are rough and raw. This scrubs the palate with high acidity and hard tannins, while flavors of raspberry and plum are basic and herbal. A lean, scratchy finish brings no surprises.[EOD]wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Delicate and detailed, this balanced Pinot Noir displays a perfect mix of wild berry, mushroom, green tea and a whiff of compost. These threads of flavor, and others associated with them, create a delightful tapestry that continues through the lengthy finish.[EOD]wine review : Australia : New South Wales : Shiraz : The Tyrrell family was excited about its 2014s when I visited there earlier this year, and this suggests their ebullience is well founded. The aromas are fresh and floral, loaded with cherry-berry fruit and a hint of cracked pepper, while on the palate, the wine is medium bodied and supple, with a long, peppery, silky finish.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese Grosso : La Poderina's Rosso offers elegant notes of fine spice backed by small forest berries and currants. This wine excels at being intense and powerful but in a uniquely understated way. The finish is silky and smooth.[EOD]wine review : Portugal : Vinho Verde : Rosé : A sweet and fizzy wine, this is also tight with acidity and textured with tannins. It has a mineral edge along with the intense crispness that is really too much.[EOD]wine review : Portugal : Port : Port : A dry wine, firmly tannic, although also with acidity and black currant fruit. Spices and licorice add interest, while the tannins finish this attractive wine.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Shows all the hallmarks of a fine Chard, except complexity. It's dry, creamy and smoky in oak and lees influences, with flavors of pineapples and peaches. Easy to find, with 250,000 cases produced.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Growing a little tired, with the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit beginning to dry out. Yet the wine is clean and sprightly in acidity.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Veneto : Red Blend : Pressed violet, baked plum, baking spice and coconut emerge on the nose and carry over to the full-bodied palate along with ripe black cherry and licorice. Tightly packed but refined tannins provide firm support.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo : Despite showing rusticity and leather on the bouquet, this smells encouraging and improves with airing as spice and subtle berry aromas take over. A creamy, layered palate is home to cinnamon, dry spice, earth and leathery flavors in addition to tobacco and dried cherry. Residual oak and spice are driving the finish on this mature wine. Drink now through 2015.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This fresh, stalky wine has hints of wood. The fruit is light and only just ripe, giving it a tight character, with plenty of acidity and a dry core of tannins. It will be ready to drink in a crisp way from 2017.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Red Blend : This presents aromas of toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of burned tire rubber. The lean palate displays raw, red cherry, coffee and oak extract alongside astringent tannins that leave an abrupt, bitter finish.[EOD]wine review : Germany : Mosel : Riesling : Layers of smoke, spice and lanolin cast a shadowy tone to summery peach and tangerine flavors on this semi-sweet Riesling. Nuances of mineral, spice and fruit build in intensity on the palate, augmented by brisk lemony acidity. Finishes long with a delicate lace of sweetness.[EOD]wine review : France : Alsace : Sparkling Blend : A soft, rather soapy-textured wine, without much focus. It's attractive in a gentle way, missing the bite.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : Despite the fancy Lot designation, this is a simple Petite Sirah. It's soft and lush in licorice and blackberry jam flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Fine for drinking now with burgers, ribs, Mexican fare.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Sparkling Blend : This fruity and sweet bubbly has a vivid hot-pink color and aromas like maraschino cherries, then red-cherry flavors, a smooth texture and cotton-candy flavors on the finish.[EOD]wine review : France : Southwest France : Malbec : Château de Mercuès has had its own vineyard since the 13th century. This latest vintage is a powerful wine, pure tannic and rich Malbec, structured and with huge black fruits. The wine has weight, solid tannins and an excellent potential. Drink from 2017–2018.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Red Blend : Consistently among Italy's top-scoring wines, this vintage of the celebrated Ornellaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a gorgeous expression of the very best of European enology. It delivers extraordinary richness, succulence and intensity, but remains elegant to the end. Aromas include black cherry, spice and dark chocolate.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : White Blend : Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.[EOD]wine review : US : New York : Riesling : Zippy acidity drives this dry medium-bodied Riesling. Its fresh green-apple and lime flavors are delicate in concentration but refreshingly crisp. Drink now through 2020.[EOD]wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : Very light mango, pineapple and banana aromas are joined by flowers and minerals. Nutty notes are brought to the fore on the dry and stony palate. Finishes broad and long, with echos of the floral and mineral notes on the nose. Now it's pretty tight; best in 2002 and beyond.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : The wine is developing quickly. It has all the elements, with ripe cherry flavors and acidity along some firm tannins. They are all coming together easily and generously. The attractive, ripe wine will be ready to drink from 2022.[EOD]wine review : Germany : Pfalz : Riesling : Whiffs of sugar cookies and raspberries entice on this consistently pleasing bargain buy. Fruity and floral and a just shade off dry, its an easygoing wine but with a depth beyond what one might presume from its cheeky packaging. Finishes on a lingering white peach note.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Pecorino : There's an easy, informal quality to this white wine that makes it appropriate to pair with roast chicken or baked fish. The Pecorino grape can often be heavy and buttery, but this expression is surprisingly fresh and zesty instead.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : From a lovely site in the Sebastopol Hills, this wine is tart and tangy with pomegranate and dark cherry flavors, deepened with spicy earth and cardamom accents. It offers length, breadth and a full-bodied expression of the grape and place.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : This Zinfandel from a warm area that hugs the Arroyo Seco appellation boundary (and will likely one day be part of it) shows baked blueberry, nutmeg, clove, licorice and turned loam aromas. Its dark plum and boysenberry flavors are strong, yet rocky mineral notes, cocoa spice and upright tannins kick it up to the next level.[EOD]wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Granular and punchy upfront, with heat and animal fur aromas on the nose. Settles with airing, revealing a heavy but solid palate with plenty of oak and candied red-fruit flavors. Falls off on the finish, with mint, resin and herbal notes.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : One of the more successful Bordeaux-style blends from the Happy Canyon section of the valley, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine is complex and layered. The blackberry, black currant and spice flavors have a nice coating of oak, and turn chocolaty-rich on the finish. A bit sharp in acidity, but a real step forward.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : This tight, classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noir needs coaxing to bring out the lovely, lilting aromatics, splendid in savory dark fruit, cinnamon and tobacco. Restrained use of new oak brings a balance of richness and acidity, softened tannins and velvety texture that works in every way.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Niederösterreich : Zweigelt : Light-bodied, straightforward red, with blackberry aromas, this wine could be accentuated with chilling and is a solution for cuisine such as mixed charuterie platters or liver terrines. A friendly, uncomplicated red made for the moment, with gracious, cheerful fruitiness.[EOD]wine review : US : Washington : Chardonnay : Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Nero d'Avola : Made from Nero d'Avola from old, pre-phylloxera vines, this opens with subdued violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The dense, structured palate evokes blackberry jam, vanilla and licorice. Enjoy through 2021.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : Darkly seductive in cinnamon and blackberry, this wine is hugely mouth-filling and a tad chewy, ready for a gigantic steak off the grill, preferably while out on the range. Coffee and pepper figure prominently in this wine, especially on the finish.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Veneto : Red Blend : Crushed violet, cake spice and ripe black plum aromas lead the nose on this bold wine. The round, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside ripe, velvety tannins that lend it a polished feel.[EOD]wine review : Austria : Niederösterreich : Weissburgunder : Delicate notions of white blossom join hints of Galia melon on nose and palate, where the yeast-buffered weight makes itself felt. This is creamy, rounded but elegant and already delicious with its immense floral charm.[EOD]wine review : US : Washington : Petite Verdot : All estate-grown fruit, blended with 11% Merlot, which seems to soften up the tannins a bit. This is aromatic and complex, weaving together scents of cassis, licorice, tobacco and smoke. Flavors follow, with plenty of black cherry fruit in the concentrated core.[EOD]wine review : Greece : Corinthia : Assyrtico : Lemon preserve and melon aromas are followed by peach and tropical fruit flavors, all balanced with telltale Greek acidity. Balanced and well made, and a good pairing with fruit, salads and seafood.[EOD]wine review : Portugal : Lisboa : Rosé : Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Red Blend : Light in color but heavy in oak, Alcineo is a modern Tuscan red that puts big emphasis on wood-driven aromas of spice and vanilla. There are some bright cherry and citrus flavors on the finish.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Casablanca Valley : Chardonnay : No shortage of oak is apparent from the get-go. The nose is woody, plump, sweet and soft, while the palate is balanced and creamy, with apple, spice and melony flavors. Definitely a big, buxom wine with plenty of vanilla and resin on the finish. Generous in a purely New World style.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : The aromas and tastes of oak dominate this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and sweet caramel riding high over the pineapple, mango and pear flavors. But crisp acidity provides needed balance, and there's a fine minerality that gives a tang of stone. A good price for a Chard this complicated.[EOD]wine review : Argentina : Other : Cabernet Franc : Foxy aromas of wet dog and plum and berry feed into a raw tannic palate. This tastes herbal, with a green note added to its core red-fruit flavors. A choppy, hard-tannin finish is rugged and abrasive.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Solidly structured, this is a dense wine. Its black fruits add to the density, giving a concentrated, fruity wine. Drink this starting from mid-2018.[EOD]wine review : US : Texas : Viognier : Canned peach, banana and lilting white-flower aromas show some good concentration on the nose. The palate is playful and textured, with a pop of tropical fruit on the entry and more florals on the midpalate. A peach-fuzz texture tingles on the close.[EOD]wine review : France : Loire Valley : Pinot Noir : This is a fine wine with its balanced red-cherry and berry flavors and finely textured tannins. The wine is light, poised and very stylish with its fruit and acidity just right. The wine will age another few months, so drink from 2018.[EOD]wine review : South Africa : Robertson : Sauvignon Blanc : Here's a well balanced and easy to drink value priced Sauv Blanc, offering notes of sweet grass, barely ripe peach and melon on the nose and mouth. Perfect for summer entertaining; pair with sushi or cocktail shrimp.[EOD]wine review : Israel : Galilee : Petite Sirah : This is a deep violet-red wine, with aromas of blackberry, blueberry, butterscotch and anisette. Flavors of blueberry, toffee and licorice play off of strong woody notes that dominate the finish.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Veneto : Garganega : Delicate spring wildflower and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass. The simple, diluted palate mirrors the nose, offering hints of pear and peach, with zesty acidity.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo : Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Red Blend : Cherry cough drop and minerally, almost chlorine aromas lead to an edgy high-acid hard palate. This blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah tastes medicinal and like creamy but fiery red plum. A screechy-feeling, chocolaty-tasting finish leaves an impression.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : A very pale color, aromas of white pepper and fresh fennel bulb, tropical fruit flavors, good firm acidity and just a touch of sweetness to balance that tartness all add up to a flavorful, lively and light-bodied wine.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Mellow and subtle, this is a soft-spoken but deeply flavorful special bottling from Navarro. It has great balance, reserved raspberry and black cherry flavors and an appetizing, firmly tannic texture. Save a few bottles until 2020 to see how well it develops.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : This offers aromas and flavors suggesting unripe apricot, peach and lime. The simple palate is a bit raw, but crisp acidity gives it clean, bright finish.[EOD]wine review : Greece : Florina : Merlot : This Merlot from one of Greece's most exciting producers offers aromas of plum, black cherry and vanilla on the nose, followed by smooth, integrated flavors of black fruit, cinnamon, pepper and a spin of mint on the finish. Layered and elegant, with good acidity for food pairing.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Red Blend : Sanguine, high-toned red fruit features prominently in this almost-equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Dusty tannin and a relatively light-bodied texture belie the power lurking beneath, the finish a hit of Red Hots and cherry cola.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : For those who like their Cabernets in a drier style. An elegant wine of considerable finesse, with modest alcohol framing berry, currant, cocoa and herb flavors. Grows more attractive and complex as it breathes in the glass.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : From a notoriously tannic grape variety comes this well-polished yet massively concentrated wine. Gorgeous, softly ripe berry and black-fig flavors demand attention from the first whiff to the lingering finish. Delicious to drink now with meat or game, it will age well through at least 2020.[EOD]wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Gris : This is a good, rich, leesy and immediately appealing wine, with great texture and a fine mix of melon, apricot and peach flavors. For the price, it's hard to find a better Pinot Gris.[EOD]wine review : South Africa : Durbanville : Sauvignon Blanc : Fresh but earthy aromas of apple, fig and pepper give this intriguing wine extra draw. On the palate, a robust herbal character backed by an appealing slatey spin and balanced acids offer elegance and personality. Ends with a clean, lingering finish.[EOD]wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : From vineyards in the Entre-deux-Mers region of Bordeaux, this Fontana family wine has a dry core surrounded by ripe, fresh fruit. It is still young and should age, certainly until 2017.[EOD]wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Fragrant blue flower, woodland berry, dark spice and pine forest aromas lead the way. It's racy, focused and loaded with chiseled finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, crushed cranberry, cinnamon and star anise. Tightly knit, refined tannins and firm acidity provide the backbone. Drink 2023–2033.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Leyda Valley : Pinot Noir : Leafy, scratchy aromas of dried plum and raspberry give way to lemony, grainy oak scents. This is medium bodied, tightly wound and tastes of dried red fruits mixed with cocoa powder. A spicy, dry, crisp finish reinforces the wine's limitations.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo : Familiar berry aromas blend with hard spice notes and a hint of blueberry. Like many 2013s, this is showing a clamped-down mouthfeel along with flavors of peppery black fruits. A limited finish is hard and compact. Drink or hold for another five or more years; this isn't going anywhere.[EOD]wine review : US : Washington : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This wine is 35% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Franc, 27% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. It brings a whole lot of appeal with its aromas of coffee, woodspice, blackberries and dark cherries. The palate shows a mixture of grace and power and the finish won't quit.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.[EOD]wine review : US : California : White Blend : Mouthwatering acidity gives this white blend needed balance to the orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime and mango flavors. It's distinctly sweet, with a sugary finish.[EOD]wine review : France : Rhône Valley : Rhône-style Red Blend : Cherries, leather and earth all mingle on the nose and palate of this medium-bodied wine. It's a pleasant, easy-to-drink offering, even if it's not terribly concentrated or complex. Drink now.[EOD]wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : The aromas suggest this wine has too much wood for its own good. The palate is just rich enough to sustain all that toast, while also allowing room for some crisp white and green fruits. Drink this wine from 2016.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : A good, everyday Chardonnay that gets the job done with proper peach and pear flavors, overlaid with oak and wrapped into a creamy texture.[EOD]wine review : Spain : Central Spain : Tempranillo : A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.[EOD]wine review : Australia : South Australia : Cabernet Sauvignon : This amply endowed, creamy-textured Cab may not make old bones, but it offers a delicious mouthful of rich cassis fruit, accented by hints of mint, tobacco and dark chocolate. It's silky enough to drink now, with a long, slightly warm finish.[EOD]wine review : Chile : Central Valley : Chardonnay : Gritty white-fruit aromas show a note of vanilla. This tastes of bland passion fruit, with a weedy note thrown in. On the finish, this doesn't give much at all.[EOD]wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Red Blend : Fruity, floral and calm on the nose, with nothing aggressive or out of place. The palate is deep, flush and offers great mouthfeel, while the flavors run toward big, juicy berry, cassis and chocolate. Like most Catena high-enders, this Cabernet-Malbec blend features a toasty finish of coffee and mocha, and overall it's stylish and impressive. Drink now through 2014.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This is a soft, simple Chardonnay, sugary sweet in vanilla, caramel, peach and pineapple jam and spice flavors. A good coat of acidity provides needed balance.[EOD]wine review : US : California : Merlot : Aromas like brown sugar and bourbon meet bold oaky, spicy flavors in this medium-bodied wine. This will be good for fans of those exotic oak flavors.[EOD]wine review : Australia : Western Australia : Cabernet Sauvignon : Oatley Wines, based in eastern Australia, sources a few bottlings from out west, like this flagship Cabernet.
