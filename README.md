# Smoll GPT

A **compact language model** tailored for generating wine reviews. It leverages a curated dataset of wine tasting notes and a NanoGPT-inspired architecture to deliver coherent, flavorful descriptions with minimal resources.

## üì¶ Project Overview

* **Model size**: 846,340 parameters
* **Weights file**: 3.5‚ÄØMB (`gpt_model.pth`)
* **Dataset**: [zynicide/wine-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews)

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the tokenizer, train the model, and generate wine reviews.

## üìù Dataset Processing

All raw reviews were converted into the format:

```
wine review : {Country} : {Province} : {Variety} : {Description}
```

* **joined\_text.txt**: Complete dataset with `[EOD]` delimiters.
* **sample\_text.txt**: Subset of 200 random documents (for quick experimentation).
* **tokenizer.txt**: 250 samples concatenated with spaces to train the tokenizer.

*Processing note*: Converting `joined_text.txt` with the current (single-threaded) tokenizer takes \~2:20:53; parallelization can reduce this to \~0:00:33.

---

## üî† Tokenizer

Implement a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer trained on:

1. `tokenizer.txt` (74,412‚ÄØchars)
2. Three Wikipedia articles (\~74,635‚ÄØchars total):

   * [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine)
   * [Alcoholic beverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage)
   * [Old World wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_wine)

* **Vocabulary size**: 5,000 tokens
* **Outputs**: `vocab.json`, `merges.json`

**Implementation details**:

```python
PRETOKENIZE_PATTERN = r"(?:'s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d)|\s?\p{L}+|\s?\p{N}+|\s?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+"
SPECIAL_TOKENS = ['[EOD]']
```

Provides `encode(text) -> List[int]` and `decode(tokens) -> str`.
